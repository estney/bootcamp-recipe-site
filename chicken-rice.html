    <h2>HAINAN CHICKEN SAUCE 1: GINGER-GARLIC SAUCE</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4-inch piece of ginger, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
      <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Grind the ginger and garlic in a food processor until a paste forms. Heat
      the oil in a small pot or saucepan. Gently fry the ginger and garlic until
      aromatic and just lightly caramelized. You want to cook it just until it
      no longer has that spicy raw flavor of uncooked ginger and garlic. Add
      salt to taste and transfer to a sauce dish.
